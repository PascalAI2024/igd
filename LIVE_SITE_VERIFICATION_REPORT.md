# Live Site Verification Report
Generated: January 7, 2025

## Executive Summary

The live site verification reveals **critical issues** with the image fixes that were supposedly deployed:

1. **AI/ML Hero Image**: ❌ **NOT WORKING** - The hero image is completely missing
2. **CRM 3D Visualization**: ❌ **NOT WORKING** - No canvas element or 3D visualization rendering
3. **404 Image Errors**: ✅ **FIXED** - No broken image links detected

## Detailed Findings

### 1. AI/ML Service Page (/services/ai-machine-learning)

**Status: CRITICAL FAILURE**

- **Hero Image**: The AI/ML hero image (`ai-ml-hero.webp`) is not loading at all
- **Visual Result**: Black background with text only - no hero image displayed
- **Images Found**: Only 3 images loaded:
  - `iconlogo.png` (navbar logo)
  - `ai-usecase-1.webp` (use case image)
  - `iconlogo.png` (footer logo)
- **Missing**: The main hero image that should display at the top of the page

**Screenshot Evidence**: The page shows only text on a black background where the hero image should be.

### 2. CRM Service Page (/services/crm)

**Status: CRITICAL FAILURE**

- **3D Visualization**: No canvas element detected
- **React Three Fiber**: Not present on the page
- **WebGL**: Not active
- **Visual Result**: Static text content only - no interactive 3D visualization
- **Text Overlaps**: 5 overlaps detected (though these appear to be parent/child element overlaps, not visual issues)

**Screenshot Evidence**: The page shows only static content with no 3D visualization present.

### 3. Image Loading Performance

**Status: SUCCESS**

- **Homepage**: 2 images loaded, 0 failures
- **AI/ML Page**: 3 images loaded, 0 failures
- **CRM Page**: 1 image loaded, 0 failures
- **No 404 Errors**: All image requests are successful

## Root Cause Analysis

The verification reveals that while image paths are correctly resolved (no 404s), the actual components that should display the hero image and 3D visualizations are not rendering:

1. **AI/ML Hero Image**: The component responsible for rendering the hero background is either:
   - Not importing the image correctly
   - Not applying it as a background style
   - Being overridden by other styles

2. **CRM 3D Visualization**: The 3D components are either:
   - Not being imported/rendered in production
   - Failing silently due to build optimization
   - Removed from the production bundle

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Check Build Output**: Verify that the production build includes:
   - The AI/ML hero image in the final bundle
   - The 3D visualization components for CRM

2. **Component Investigation**: 
   - Review the AI/ML page component to ensure hero image is properly imported and styled
   - Check if 3D components are being tree-shaken out during build
   - Verify lazy loading isn't preventing component rendering

3. **Style Debugging**:
   - Check if CSS is properly applying background images
   - Ensure no style conflicts are hiding the hero image
   - Verify z-index and positioning issues

## Conclusion

**The deployed fixes have NOT resolved the reported issues.** While the image files themselves are accessible (no 404s), the components responsible for displaying the AI/ML hero image and CRM 3D visualization are not functioning in production. This requires immediate investigation and re-deployment.

### Overall Status: ❌ FAILED

- ❌ AI/ML Hero Image: Not displayed
- ❌ CRM 3D Visualization: Not rendered
- ✅ No 404 errors: Image paths are correct
- ⚠️ Visual presentation: Severely degraded without hero image and 3D content
