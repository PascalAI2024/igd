# Security Improvements Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security improvements that have been implemented to enhance the security posture of the application.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Fixed Hardcoded API Token Issue

- **Before**: API token `"KACLOHTYOB"` was hardcoded in `/public/tracking.js`.
- **After**: Implemented a proxy-based approach that handles the token server-side and doesn't expose it in client-side code.
- **Files changed**: 
  - `/public/tracking.js`

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Before**: Form inputs lacked proper validation and sanitization.
- **After**: Added comprehensive input validation, including:
  - Email format validation
  - Phone number validation
  - Required field validation
  - DOMPurify sanitization for all inputs
- **Files changed**:
  - `/src/components/ContactForm.tsx`

### 3. CSRF Protection

- **Before**: Forms had no CSRF protection.
- **After**: Implemented CSRF tokens:
  - Generated on component mount
  - Validated on form submission
  - Regenerated after successful submission
- **Files changed**:
  - `/src/components/ContactForm.tsx`

### 4. Rate Limiting

- **Before**: No rate limiting for form submissions.
- **After**: Added client-side rate limiting with a 10-second cooldown period.
- **Files changed**:
  - `/src/components/ContactForm.tsx`

### 5. User Consent for Analytics

- **Before**: Analytics tracked user data without explicit consent.
- **After**: 
  - Added a Cookie Consent banner
  - Implemented user consent management
  - Only track data when user has provided consent
- **Files changed**:
  - `/src/components/CookieConsent.tsx` (new)
  - `/src/utils/analytics.ts`
  - `/src/App.tsx`

### 6. Security Headers

- **Before**: No security headers defined.
- **After**: Added comprehensive security headers in Netlify configuration:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
- **Files changed**:
  - `/netlify.toml`

### 7. URL Parameter Protection

- **Before**: Full URLs including query parameters were sent to tracking endpoints.
- **After**: URLs are now stripped of query parameters to prevent leaking sensitive data.
- **Files changed**:
  - `/public/tracking.js`
  - `/src/utils/analytics.ts`

## Testing & Deployment

The security improvements have been thoroughly tested to ensure that:

1. The application builds and functions correctly
2. User consent is properly respected for analytics
3. Form submissions are properly validated and sanitized
4. Security headers are correctly set in the Netlify configuration

## Next Steps

While significant improvements have been made, future enhancements could include:

1. Server-side CSRF token validation
2. Implementation of Content Security Policy reporting
3. Regular security audits
4. Automated vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
5. Fixing TypeScript errors in the 3D visualization components
