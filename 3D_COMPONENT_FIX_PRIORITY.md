- [ ] Optimize for mobile (reduce complexity)
- [ ] Make canvas responsive (600px → percentage)

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. ThreeDPieChart
**File**: `/src/components/charts/ThreeDPieChart.tsx`
- [ ] Improve Html component inline styles
- [ ] Make default height responsive
- [ ] Increase font size in labels (12px → 14px minimum)
- [ ] Add mobile-specific optimizations

### 8. All Service Wrapper Components
**Files**: Various service-specific components that use ProcessFlow3D
- [ ] Ensure they pass proper responsive props
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement error boundaries

## Common Fixes Across All Components

### Text & Typography
```tsx
// Before
<Text fontSize={0.08} color="white">

// After
<Text fontSize={0.2} color="white">
```

### Dynamic Classes
```tsx
// Before
className={`bg-${color}/20`}

// After
style={{ backgroundColor: `${color}33` }}
```

### Responsive Canvas
```tsx
// Before
<div className="h-[500px]">

// After
<div className="h-[50vh] min-h-[300px] max-h-[600px]">
```

### Font References
```tsx
// Remove all instances of:
font="/fonts/Inter-Bold.woff"
font="/fonts/Inter-Medium.woff"
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Fix ProcessFlow3D (impacts multiple components)
2. **Week 1**: Fix CRMDashboard3D and LocalBusinessVisualization3D
3. **Week 2**: Fix OptimizedLeadFunnel3D and RankingVisualizer3D
4. **Week 2**: Fix SystemNetwork3D and ThreeDPieChart
5. **Week 3**: Test all fixes across devices and implement remaining optimizations

## Testing Checklist

### Desktop (1920x1080)
- [ ] Text readable at normal viewing distance
- [ ] No overlapping elements
- [ ] Smooth performance (60fps)

### Tablet (768x1024)
- [ ] Canvas scales appropriately
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Performance acceptable (30fps+)

### Mobile (375x667)
- [ ] Canvas fits screen properly
- [ ] Text large enough to read
- [ ] Performance optimized (reduced complexity)
- [ ] Touch interactions work correctly

## Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)
1. Global font size increase in all 3D components
2. Remove all font file references
3. Replace fixed heights with responsive units
4. Fix all dynamic Tailwind classes

These fixes will ensure all 3D visualizations maintain the same professional quality as the rest of the application.
