# GitHub Issues for 3D Performance

## Issue 1: Three.js Resource Manager - Prevent Memory Leaks in 3D Components

### Problem
Multiple 3D visualization components (ThreeDBarChart, ThreeDPieChart, ProcessFlow3D, NetworkVisualization3D) create geometries, materials, and textures without proper cleanup, leading to memory leaks.

### Solution
Create a shared resource management system for Three.js components that:
- Centralizes texture loading with caching
- Tracks geometry and material creation
- Provides automatic disposal on component unmount
- Implements reference counting for shared resources

### Affected Components
- src/components/charts/ThreeDBarChart.tsx
- src/components/charts/ThreeDPieChart.tsx
- src/components/services/shared/ProcessFlow3D.tsx
- src/components/services/shared/NetworkVisualization3D.tsx

### Priority
High - Memory leaks can cause performance degradation over time

## Issue 2: Implement Level of Detail (LOD) System for 3D Visualizations

### Problem
All 3D components render at full quality regardless of viewport distance or device capabilities, causing unnecessary performance overhead on lower-end devices.

### Solution
Implement a LOD system that:
- Reduces polygon count for distant objects
- Simplifies shaders based on distance
- Adjusts particle counts dynamically
- Uses device capabilities from useDeviceCapabilities hook

### Affected Components
- All 3D visualization components
- Especially complex ones like NetworkVisualization3D and ProcessFlow3D

### Priority
Medium - Significant performance improvement for complex scenes

## Issue 3: Battery-Aware 3D Rendering

### Problem
Three.js components don't respect battery optimization settings from AnimationController. They continue to render at full frame rates even on low battery.

### Solution
- Integrate battery status checks into Canvas components
- Reduce frame rate on low battery (< 20%)
- Disable post-processing effects when on battery
- Sync with existing AnimationController battery logic

### Affected Components
- All Three.js/React Three Fiber components
- AnimationController integration

### Priority
Medium - Important for mobile user experience

## Issue 4: WebGL Context Recovery Mechanism

### Problem
No recovery mechanism when WebGL context is lost (common on mobile devices when switching tabs or apps). Users see blank/broken visualizations.

### Solution
Implement WebGL context loss handling:
- Listen for webglcontextlost events
- Store component state before loss
- Attempt to restore context
- Show appropriate error state during recovery
- Reinitialize Three.js scene after recovery

### Affected Components
- All Canvas-based 3D components
- AnimationErrorBoundary enhancement

### Priority
High - Critical for mobile reliability

## Issue 5: Implement Texture Atlas System

### Problem
Multiple components load individual textures (icons, images) causing unnecessary draw calls and memory usage.

### Solution
Create a texture atlas system:
- Combine common icons/textures into sprite sheets
- Load atlas once and share across components
- Reduce draw calls significantly
- Implement UV mapping for atlas usage

### Affected Components
- NetworkVisualization3D (node icons)
- ProcessFlow3D (step icons)
- Any component loading multiple small textures

### Priority
Low - Performance optimization

## Testing Requirements
- Memory profiling before/after fixes
- Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Battery drain testing
- Context loss simulation
- Performance benchmarks with Chrome DevTools
