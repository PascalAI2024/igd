# Security Improvements Implementation

This document outlines security improvements that have been implemented in the codebase based on the recommendations from the security audit.

## Implemented Security Enhancements

### 1. Server-Side Proxy for API Tokens

**Issue**: API tokens were previously hardcoded in client-side code.

**Implementation**:
- Created Netlify serverless functions to handle API requests securely
- Moved all API tokens to environment variables on the server
- Implemented proper token handling in `netlify/functions/api-proxy.js`
- Added client-side utility in `src/utils/apiProxy.ts` for secure API communication

```javascript
// Server-side API proxy (netlify/functions/api-proxy.js)
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY; // Stored securely as env variable
```

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection

**Issue**: Form inputs lacked proper validation and sanitization.

**Implementation**:
- Added DOMPurify for sanitizing all user inputs
- Implemented strict validation for all form fields
- Enhanced the form handling to prevent XSS attacks
- Created a centralized validation library for consistent form validation

```typescript
// sanitizeFormData function in form-handler.js
const sanitizedFormData = sanitizeFormData(formData);
```

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

**Issue**: Forms lacked CSRF protection.

**Implementation**:
- Added cryptographically secure CSRF tokens to all forms
- Implemented token verification on both client and server sides
- Added CSRF checks in form submission handlers

```typescript
// CSRF token generation and verification
const csrfToken = generateCSRFToken(ip, timestamp);
const isValid = validateCSRFToken(token, ip, timestamp);
```

### 4. Enhanced Security Headers

**Issue**: Missing important security headers in Netlify configuration.

**Implementation**:
- Added comprehensive security headers to `netlify.toml`
- Implemented Content-Security-Policy (CSP) with appropriate directives
- Added X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; ..."
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Permissions-Policy = "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()..."
```

### 5. Rate Limiting Implementation

**Issue**: No rate limiting for form submissions could allow form spam.

**Implementation**:
- Added rate limiting for all form submissions
- Implemented IP-based request tracking
- Set appropriate thresholds for different form types

```javascript
// Rate limiting implementation in form-handler.js
const RATE_LIMIT = 5; // Max submissions per IP per 5 minutes
const ipSubmissions = new Map();

const checkRateLimit = (ip) => {
  // Rate limiting logic
};
```

### 6. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Issue**: Incomplete input validation and sanitization.

**Implementation**:
- Created robust validation functions for all input types
- Added maximum length constraints to all form inputs
- Implemented typed interfaces for form data
- Configured DOMPurify with stricter settings to block all HTML tags

```typescript
// validateFormData function in form-handler.js
const validation = validateFormData(formData);
if (!validation.valid) {
  return {
    statusCode: 400,
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({ error: validation.error })
  };
}
```

### 7. Error Handling Improvements

**Issue**: Error handling that could potentially expose sensitive information.

**Implementation**:
- Implemented standardized error responses that don't leak implementation details
- Added reference IDs for errors to help with troubleshooting without exposing internals
- Created consistent error handling patterns across the application

```javascript
// Secure error handling
return {
  statusCode: 500,
  headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    error: 'An error occurred while processing your request',
    reference: crypto.randomBytes(4).toString('hex')
  })
};
```

## New Components and Utilities

### API Proxy Utility

- `src/utils/apiProxy.ts`: Secure client-side utility for making API requests
- Handles CSRF tokens, request formatting, and error handling

### Form Submission Proxy

- `netlify/functions/form-handler.js`: Serverless function for secure form handling
- Validates, sanitizes, and processes form submissions

### Enhanced Form Components

- `src/components/EnhancedContactForm.tsx`: Updated contact form using secure API proxy
- `src/components/FormStatus.tsx`: Updated to support direct status control
- `src/components/SubmitButton.tsx`: Enhanced with external loading control

### React Hooks for API Interaction

- `src/hooks/useApi.ts`: Custom hooks for secure API interactions
- Provides loading, error, and success states for forms and API requests

## Setup and Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set in your Netlify dashboard:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api-endpoint.com
FORM_ENDPOINT=https://your-form-endpoint.com
FORM_API_KEY=your_form_api_key_here
RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_recaptcha_secret_here
CSRF_SECRET=your_csrf_secret_here
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Installation

Run the setup script to install dependencies for the Netlify functions:

```bash
npm run setup-functions
```

## Remaining Security Tasks

1. Test cookie consent functionality and ensure it persists user choices
2. Check for vulnerable dependencies and update if needed
3. Implement automated security testing
4. Add more sophisticated rate limiting (e.g., with Redis)
5. Enhance logging for security events

## Conclusion

These security improvements have significantly enhanced the application's security posture by:

1. Protecting API tokens and secrets
2. Preventing XSS and CSRF attacks
3. Implementing proper input validation and sanitization
4. Adding rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Improving error handling to avoid information leakage
6. Enhancing security headers for better browser protection

The changes follow security best practices and address all critical and high-priority issues identified in the security audit.
