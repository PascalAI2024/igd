# GitHub Issues to Create for Build & Deployment Improvements

## Issue 1: Add GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Title**: Add GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
**Labels**: enhancement, infrastructure
**Description**:

### Overview
We need to implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and automated testing before deployment.

### Requirements
1. **TypeScript Checks**: Run `npm run typecheck` on every PR
2. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` on every PR  
3. **Build Validation**: Run `npm run validate` to ensure builds succeed
4. **Automated PR Previews**: Generate preview deployments for PRs
5. **Branch Protection**: Require CI checks to pass before merging

### Benefits
- Catch TypeScript errors before they reach production
- Ensure code quality standards are maintained
- Prevent broken builds from being deployed
- Enable team to preview changes before merging

### Implementation
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs for:
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint checks  
- Build validation
- Optional: Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

## Issue 2: Enhanced Build Monitoring & Performance Budgets

**Title**: Implement Build Monitoring and Performance Budgets
**Labels**: enhancement, performance
**Description**:

### Overview
Implement automated monitoring of build artifacts and enforce performance budgets to maintain optimal site performance.

### Requirements
1. **Bundle Size Tracking**: Track and report bundle sizes over time
2. **Performance Budgets**: Set limits for:
   - JavaScript bundle sizes (< 500KB per chunk)
   - CSS file sizes (< 100KB per file)
   - Total page weight
3. **Lighthouse CI Integration**: 
   - Run Lighthouse tests on every build
   - Track Core Web Vitals
   - Fail builds that don't meet performance thresholds
4. **Build Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize trends in:
   - Bundle sizes
   - Build times
   - Performance metrics

### Benefits
- Prevent performance regressions
- Maintain fast loading times
- Better visibility into build health
- Proactive performance optimization

### Implementation
- Use webpack-bundle-analyzer for detailed bundle analysis
- Integrate Lighthouse CI with GitHub Actions
- Set up performance budget configuration
- Create monitoring dashboard (could use Netlify Analytics)

## Issue 3: Improve Build Error Handling & Recovery

**Title**: Enhance Build Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms
**Labels**: enhancement, developer-experience
**Description**:

### Overview
Improve the build process to handle errors more gracefully and provide better recovery options.

### Current Issues
- `build-force` command bypasses TypeScript checks (security risk)
- No automated rollback on failed deployments
- Limited error reporting

### Requirements
1. **Remove build-force**: Eliminate the bypass option entirely
2. **Better Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
3. **Automated Rollback**: Implement rollback on deployment failures
4. **Build Status Notifications**: Send notifications on build failures
5. **Error Recovery Guide**: Document common build errors and fixes

### Implementation
- Update package.json to remove build-force
- Implement pre-commit hooks to catch errors early
- Set up deployment notifications (Slack/Email)
- Create comprehensive error documentation
