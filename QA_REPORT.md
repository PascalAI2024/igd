# QA Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Images in Case Studies
- **Issue**: Case study images were referencing non-existent files
- **Fix**: Updated image paths in case study data files to use available images:
  - Changed `auto-service.webp` to `erp-platform.webp`
  - Changed `local-retail.webp` to `fintech-platform.webp`
  - Changed `manufacturing-platform.webp` to `healthcare-platform.webp`

### 2. Navigation Timing
- **Issue**: Navigation attempts during loading sequence animation fail
- **Details**: Loading sequence shows 5 messages with animations:
  1. "Initializing Neural Network"
  2. "Synthesizing Digital Pathways"
  3. "Calibrating Innovation Matrix"
  4. "Engaging Quantum Processors"
  5. "Activating Digital Excellence"
- **Note**: Must wait approximately 5-6 seconds for loading sequence to complete before navigation is possible

## Remaining Warnings

### 1. React Router Future Flag Warnings
```
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: React Router will begin wrapping state updates in `React.startTransition` in v7.
⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: Relative route resolution within Splat routes is changing in v7.
```
- **Recommendation**: Consider enabling future flags to prepare for React Router v7:
  ```javascript
  {
    future: {
      v7_startTransition: true,
      v7_relativeSplatPath: true
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. CSS Warning
```
@import rules are not allowed here
```
- **Recommendation**: Replace @import rules with proper CSS module imports or bundled stylesheets

## Available Images
The following images are available in public/case-studies/:
- erp-platform.webp
- fintech-platform.webp
- healthcare-platform.webp

## Navigation Testing
- Home page loads successfully
- Case Studies page navigation works after loading sequence completes
- All case study images display correctly with updated paths
